antigen-themes
==============

ZSH / antigen themes I have created.

use it via antigen (no need to clone first):

```
antigen-theme bbenne10/antigen-themes themes/bbennett
```

or just clone it and modify it. I'd be interested in seeing changes you've made :)

Currently this is used as a purely personal repo (without backwards compatability
taken into account). If any user contacts me, I'll be happy to begin making
changes in a backwards compatible way.
